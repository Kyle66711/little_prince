    As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and <center></center>
    set out walking once more.
    <u> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me <center></center>that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</u> </span>  <span class="highlighted">It seemed to <center></center> me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> <center></center>
    In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, <center></center>
    his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: <center></center>
    <FONT COLOR="#ff0000 "> "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most <center></center>
        important is invisible..." <FONT COLOR="#000000 ">As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion <center></center>
            of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: <FONT COLOR="#ff0000 "> "What moves me so deeply, <center></center>
                about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a <center></center>
                flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like <center></center>
                the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep ..." <FONT COLOR="#000000 "> And I felt him to <center></center>
                    be more fragile still. <u>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he <center></center>
                        himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind.<u> <center></center>
